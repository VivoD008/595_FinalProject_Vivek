## Cape May County, New Jersey
Cape May County is the southernmost county in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Much of the county is located on the Cape May peninsula, bound by the Delaware Bay to its west and the Atlantic Ocean to its south and east.
Sea level rise poses a threat to people and property in coastal areas around the world and is especially acute in [New Jersey.](https://njclimateresourcecenter.rutgers.edu/climate_change_101/sea-level-rise-in-new-jersey-projections-and-impacts/)
This makes Cape May County inhabitants equally vuleranle to sea level rise.
In Cape May, sea level rose 11 inches from 1970 to present. Under the Intermediate Scenario, sea level is expected to rise 12 inches from [2020 to 2050](https://sealevel.globalchange.gov/national-sea-level-explorer/?psmsl_id=1153&scope=section_1#:~:text=In%20Cape%20May%2C%20sea%20level,inches%20from%201970%20to%20present.)
In addition, residents of Cape May are also exposed to other environmental burdens such as exposure to contaminated sites.
Exposure to hazardous materials as well as the threat of rising sea levels puts residents at severe risk.

**Research Questions:** To understand the level of exposure of known Contaminated Sites and to visualize the extent of sea level rise over essential infrastructure like Public Schools and Food Pantries in Cape May County, New Jersey.
